- [ ] Add a link to the wikipedia page for each apparition
- [ ] Add a link to the shrine for each apparition that has one built at the demand of Our Lady
- [ ] Add images to each apparition

### Regarding the ecclesiastical conclusions

Since 2024, the possible conclusions are as follow:

- *Nihil obstat*: Without expressing certainty about the event itself, there
  may be an appreciation of the potential spiritual and pastoral value, where
  the diocesan bishop is encouraged to promote its spread, including through
  possible pilgrimages to a sacred site;
- *Prae oculis habeatur*: A recognition of certain positive signs, but notes
  there are some aspects of the event that may need further discernment or may
  cause confusion;
- *Curatur*: An event where there have been "verifiable spiritual fruits" and
  where an outright ban "could upset the People of God," but where the bishop
  is asked "not to encourage this phenomenon but to seek out alternative
  expressions of devotion and possibly reorient its spiritual and pastoral
  aspects";
- *Sub mandato*: An occasion where a person, family or group is misusing an
  event or occurrence that could potentially lead to exploitation;
- *Prohibetur et obstruatur*: An occurrence where some legitimate merits are
  found, but where there appear to be "very serious" risks. In order to prevent
  confusion or scandal, the bishop is asked to declare that adherence to the
  phenomenon is not allowed. The bishop is also asked to provide further
  instruction and catechesis "that can help the faithful understand the reasons
  for the decision and reorient the legitimate spiritual concerns of that part
      of the People of God;" or, 
- *Declaratio de non supernaturalitate*: An authorization to declare that the
  phenomenon is found to be not supernatural.
